                                            <p>It all began with Shamji Vaja Gada (SVG), an explorer and visionary, who in 1926 braved the Journey from India to the African Continent.  Seeing great potential in East Africa he decided to settle and build the foundations for the generations to come.</p>
                                            <p>SVG planted his roots in Kenya with a general trading and farming supplies store. In 1962, SVG’s sons set up a clothing materials shop and over the years, grew the business from textile trading to manufacturing and further diversified into a multitude of sectors with a footprint in Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and an out reach to neighboring markets in the region.</p>
                                            <p>Spin Ventures Group (SVG) has been built on strong core values with principles in business ethics, innovation, ambition and leadership, all of which have contributed to the successful navigation of the businesses through the hardships and volatility in the past decades.  This has resulted in a culture of hard-work, dedication, commitment and has equipped SVG with a valuable bank of experience and knowledge for the future.</p>
                                            <p>At SVG we continuously aspire to improve, grow and build on the successes of the past and strive to maintain the sturdy foundations for the security of our future generations.</p>

                                            <p>In 2008, SVG ventured into manufacturing polypropylene woven sacks to supply a broad range of packaging requirements across markets in Central and Southern Africa, based out of Zambia.  The company has grown to become one of the major players in the region.</p>
